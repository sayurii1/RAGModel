American Wisteria is a vigorous climber with twining stems, blooming from late spring through to summer. It forms drooping six-inch-long clusters of pea-like lilac-colored flowers, which give off a delightful aroma. American Wisteria is less damaging to structures than Chinese or Japanese species. It grows up to 30 feet tall and requires a solid structure to support itself once it matures because it can become quite heavy.
