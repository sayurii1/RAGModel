The bleeding heart flower is native to Asia and gets its common name from its puffy, heart-shaped pink blooms that dangle from long, arching stems. Beneath the heart shape is a protruding white petal tinged with a red streak that looks like a teardrop. In a typical growing season, a bleeding heart plant will produce around 20 small flowers on its stems in the spring that stay in bloom for several weeks. It may disappear after flowering in the summer, but this perennial plant, commonly purchased at nurseries, comes back every year, regrowing either in the fall or next spring. Bleeding heart plants are in the same family as poppies and are toxic to people and pets.

This is an elegant old-time favorite that is a herbaceous, delicate perennial. The stems are arched, studded with lockets of pink flowers, with protruding white petals. Hence the name, bleeding heart. They only bloom for four to six weeks in late spring, tending to disappear in the mid-summer. They are ideal for shaded borders, woodland gardens, and underplanting roses and shrubs.
