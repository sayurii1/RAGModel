Also known as Blue Dogbane, this flowering perennial produces early bloom, attractive summer foliage that changes to golden hues in fall. The flowers are star-shaped and arranged in clusters on top of sturdy stems. Bluestar is low maintenance, pest and disease resistant, and native to the US, making it a top choice for all American gardens. It needs moist and loamy soils to thrive. 

The plant species amsonia was given the common name blue star for its soft blue, star-shaped flowers. The individual flowers are small, but they bloom in fluffy clusters and put on a lovely show for several weeks. Blue star flowers are one of the truest blues you will find in flower colors.

The medium-growing plants are native to many regions of North America and grow pretty much problem free. The airy but substantial texture of the foliage provides a great foil for almost any other plant, making them very versatile in garden design. A bonus is the brilliant yellow fall color of their foliage.

Most blue star varieties will grow about 2-3 feet tall, and 2-3 feet wide, but size will depend on the variety you are growing and the growing conditions. They tend to be small, tidy, shrub-like clumps.
