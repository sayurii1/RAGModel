Baby’s breath flower we know belongs to the genus Gypsophila. You’re probably most familiar with the perennial form of baby’s breath, which is a popular ‘behind-the-scenes’ filler in bouquets, often setting off more colorful, larger blooms such as roses. It’s a common Valentine’s Day and wedding flower as well and, fittingly, a symbol of everlasting love.

In flower gardens, the small, delicate 5-petaled flowers and light green stems create an airy look that’s perfect for perennial beds, cottage gardens, and cutting gardens. It nicely hides die-back from spring bulbs and flowers. Plant in groupings. Cut it back after flowering to encourage more blooms. We think baby’s breath looks lovely in a vase all on its own in big billowy sprays.

While white is the most common color, baby’s breath comes in shades of pink, too! Blooming from late spring or summer through the fall, you can find baby’s breath in the wild in fields, roadsides, and open sandy areas. It’s drought-resistant and deer-resistant as well.
