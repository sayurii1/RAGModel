Petunia, genus of about 35 species of flowering plants in the nightshade family (Solanaceae), native to South America. The common garden petunia (Petunia ×atkinsiana) is an ornamental plant whose showy trumpet-shaped flowers make it popular for summer flower beds and window boxes.

Petunia species are mostly annual herbs. The leaves are sessile (e.g., lacking a petiole, or leaf stem) and are usually oval-shaped with smooth margins; some feature fine sticky hairs. The flowers are funnel-shaped, consisting of five fused or partially fused petals and five green sepals. Most species are insect-pollinated, though P. exserta is pollinated by hummingbirds. The minute seeds are borne in a dry capsule. Molecular evidence has led to the reclassification of some former Petunia species into the closely related genus Calibrachoa, known for the ornamental plant called “million bells”
