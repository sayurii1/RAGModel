Vervain (Verbena officinalis) is an herb that grows primarily in Europe and Asia. It’s also sometimes referred to as pigeon’s grass, herb of grace, pamukh, or karenta. The plant can grow to a height of about 40 inches. The leaves of the vervain plant are toothed and lobed, and the flowers are light purple.1

Vervain plants have been lauded for their medicinal value for hundreds of years, and used widely in traditional and folk medicine, particularly Chinese medicine. Although several studies have found vervain to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anticonvulsant properties, most of these studies were done either in a lab on animals.2 Still, vervain shows promise in treating several different medical conditions.
